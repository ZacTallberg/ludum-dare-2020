Game stuff

Main concept: Feeding a black hole to save the earth 
           
    player controls little spaceships that fly around a solar system
    can tractor beam chunks of space rock and guide them back to the black hole
    
    Start of game: 
        - Player starts out with one spaceship 
        - 

    Main mechanics:
        - Planet "factory" that constructs new units 
        - Harvest spaceship tasks 
            - harvest asteroids
            - bring packets of anti-matter to destroy blackhole
            - 
        
        - Start game: 
            - begin with one spaceship and one anti-matter factory 
            - some resources 

        - Fighter ship tasks 
            - "auto" attack mode 
            - patrol mode 
            - follow mode 
            - 

        - Resources
            - Matter
                collected from asteroids
            - Energy
                provided by generator buildings

        - Use gathered resources to build 
            - packets of anti-matter 
            - gathering ships 
            - fighting ships 
            - sensor ships
            
        - Black hole sends blobs to bring your ships back to itself 
            - Can use fighter ships to "free" ships and bring them home 
        - Fog of war 
        - 
        - Black hole slowly grows over time 
            - When it consumes a planet, pauses growth and sends out a bunch of blobs to attack you 
            - 

        - Gravity?
        - Planets move in circles around the black hole 
        


    - Core mechanics:
        - Harvesting asteroids 
        - Bringing anti-matter to blow up black hole 
        - Defending harvesters 



    - Send spaceships to bring asteroids and throw them into a black hole

    - Make the black hole larger over time slowly 

    - Lose condition:
        - Home planet is consumed by the black hole

    - Win condition:


    Camera:
        - Player can pan/zoom the camera at will 
            - With w/a/s/d and scroll wheel 
        - 


    Black hole:
        - Grows larger over time 
        - When it consumes a planet (surface touches another object), does a thing 
        -
